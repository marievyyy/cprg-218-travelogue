         <p><span class="small-font">Day 1</span>
            Ofcourse we had to start our trip with visiting a café. We head out to get some buttery croissants from Pain
            Pain and
            cappuccinos from a quaint little café. After that we walked to Sacre-Coeur and through the Montmartre
            neighborhood (fun
            fact:
            it&apos;s
            where the
            famous John Wick 4 stairs scene was filmed). Then we had unforgettable lunch at Chez Janou (highly
            recommended this).
             
            Our afternoon was We started to check things off our list, so our afternoon activity was packed! We started
            by exploring the Louvre Gardens followed by a tour
            of the Louvre
            Museum at 3:30 PM (hello, Mona Lisa!). Afterward, we climbed to the top of the Arc de Triomphe and walked
            back to the
            Eiffel Tower area in the 7th Arrondissement. I was a very surreal moment. <span class="span-block">Steps
               count: 38,560 steps (I didn't
               plan on
               resting for this vacation hehe)</span></p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 2</span>We dedicated the entire day exploring the grandeur of Versailles, and
            it is such a memorable experience. The lavish
            palace and the meticulously maintained gardens were absolutely breathtaking. We had a quick lunch at the
            on-site café to
            give us a chance to recharge before continuing our adventure. It was a long day, but absolutely worth it! I
            definitely
            would recommend visiting if you plan to visit Paris.</p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 3</span>On our third day, we decided to take it easy. We started our day with a
            delicious almond croissant and a cup of coffee
            at Café Richard. After that, we visited the stunning stained-glass windows of Sainte-Chapelle and explored
            the charming
            streets of the Latin Quarter. For lunch, we treated ourselves to some ramen at Kodawari Ramen. In the
            afternoon we
            visited the Musée d&apos;Orsay and finally got to see some famous art of Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh.
            Then we head out
            to Palace des Invalides and we wrapped up the day with a lovely dinner at La Potager.</p>

         <p><span class="small-font">Day 1</span>
            Our first day in Rome started early to beat the crowds at St. Peter&apos;s Basilica. The church was
            absolutely
            breathtaking
            with its stunning architecture and intricate details. It was the most incredible church I&apos;ve ever seen!
            From there, we
            explored the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums with a guided tour to fully absorb its history and art. In
            the
            afternoon, we climbed to the top of Castel Sant&apos;Angelo for breathtaking views of the Vatican and Rome.
            Then we had lunch at Pastacuitta, and dinner was a must-try at Pizza de Simone (pasta
            and pizza duh).</p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 2</span>
            On the second day, we visited the Colosseum and were blown away by its ancient beauty. After that, we
            wandered through
            the historic Roman Forum, and it feels like we were stepping back in time. In the afternoon, we took a fun
            break to
            Trastevere, where we had a dinner at Tonarello (We are lucky to be early because this one had a long
            line and there&apos; a reason for it! So plan accordingly if you want to eat here). And of course, no trip
            to Italy is complete without
            some gelato, so we have to try Italy&apos;s gelalo. <span class="span-block">Steps count: 37, 982
               steps</span></p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 3</span>Day 3 was a whirlwind of exploring Rome&apos;s must-see spots.
            Let&apos;s
            continue checking off our list! We kicked things off by
            tossing a coin at the Trevi Fountain it is a tradition we couldn&apos;t miss. We arrived there 6AM and it is
            already packed
            with tourists. After that, we wandered around the Piazza Navona. From there, we took a stroll through Campo
            de' Fiori to
            soak in the lively market atmosphere and check out the nearby churches. For lunch, we had a lovely meal at
            Alfredo e
            Ada, and to end the day, we treated ourselves to a delicious dinner at Bottigliera.</p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 4</span>Day 4 was a total blast! We left Rome and headed to Tivoli for a chill
            day trip. We started our day with a coffee at a
            cozy local café. Then, we had lunch at Osteria Mom, which was the perfect way to get ready for Tivoli. The
            peaceful
            surroundings were a welcome change of pace, and we felt like we were in a whole different side of the world.
            We ended
            the day back in Rome with a delicious dinner at L'Aquila d'Oro, and it was the perfect way to wrap up our
            serene and
            escape from the city.</p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 5</span>Day 5, it was our last full day in Rome, so we had to make it
            memorable. We kicked things off with a delicious maritozzo
            (which finally crossed off everything on my food list) and a cup of coffee. We visited the Borghese Museum
            and immersed
            ourselves in its stunning collection of art and sculpture. After conquering the famous Spanish Steps, we ate
            at
            Pastacuitta before checking out the Palazzo Colonna. For our final dinner, we returned to Va Do to savour
            one last
            incredible meal and reflect on our unforgettable trip.<span class="span-block">Pasta count for the whole
               trip: 8 pasta</span>
