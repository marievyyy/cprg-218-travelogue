         <h3>Our Paris trip was absolutely amazing! I soaked up all the culture and history. Each day of this trip
            brought something
            new for me to discover.

         <p><span class="small-font">Day 1</span>
            Ofcourse we had to start our trip with visiting a café. We head out to get some buttery croissants from Pain
            Pain and
            cappuccinos from a quaint little café. After that we walked to Sacre-Coeur and through the Montmartre
            neighborhood (fun
            fact:
            it&apos;s
            where the
            famous John Wick 4 stairs scene was filmed). Then we had unforgettable lunch at Chez Janou (highly
            recommended this).
             
            Our afternoon was We started to check things off our list, so our afternoon activity was packed! We started
            by exploring the Louvre Gardens followed by a tour
            of the Louvre
            Museum at 3:30 PM (hello, Mona Lisa!). Afterward, we climbed to the top of the Arc de Triomphe and walked
            back to the
            Eiffel Tower area in the 7th Arrondissement. I was a very surreal moment. <span class="span-block">Steps
               count: 38,560 steps (I didn't
               plan on
               resting for this vacation hehe)</span></p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 2</span>We dedicated the entire day exploring the grandeur of Versailles, and
            it is such a memorable experience. The lavish
            palace and the meticulously maintained gardens were absolutely breathtaking. We had a quick lunch at the
            on-site café to
            give us a chance to recharge before continuing our adventure. It was a long day, but absolutely worth it! I
            definitely
            would recommend visiting if you plan to visit Paris.</p>
         <p><span class="small-font">Day 3</span>On our third day, we decided to take it easy. We started our day with a
            delicious almond croissant and a cup of coffee
            at Café Richard. After that, we visited the stunning stained-glass windows of Sainte-Chapelle and explored
            the charming
            streets of the Latin Quarter. For lunch, we treated ourselves to some ramen at Kodawari Ramen. In the
            afternoon we
            visited the Musée d&apos;Orsay and finally got to see some famous art of Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh.
            Then we head out
            to Palace des Invalides and we wrapped up the day with a lovely dinner at La Potager.</p>
